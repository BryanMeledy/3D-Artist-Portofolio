About Me

    I’m Bryan Tannovento Meledy and I’m an IT student  currently studying at president university. Aside from  doing IT projects, I’m very passionate in doing 3D  projects. Mainly 3D modeling and creating characters. I’ve worked on lots of projects in the past. From personal  3D projects, to 3D Internship projects and college 3D projects. I think that being a 3D artist is a fun job to do and it is my primary passion.

Education

 I learned about 3D in 2019 during high-school. I like 3D  animations and I think they are cool. I then discovered an open  source 3D software called Blender. And I’ve been using it since  then. I learned a lot from online tutorials (Google, YouTube, Blogs  etc). So I’m mostly self-taught in this subject.
 I entered and studied in President University and I’ve followed a  subject called 3D Computer Graphics and Animation. I was  taught more about the 3D world. I’ve also followed the game  development subject and modeled characters and game assets  to be used in the game. And I’ve been doing a lot of projects for  that. Until now I’ve been making personal 3D projects and  college projects or team projects.
