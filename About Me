About Me

I’m Bryan Tannovento Meledy and I’m an IT student  currently studying at president university. 
Aside from  doing IT projects, I’m very passionate in doing 3D  projects. Mainly 3D modeling and creating characters. 
I’ve worked on lots of projects in the past. From personal  3D projects, to 3D Internship projects and college 3D projects. 
I think that being a 3D artist is a fun job to do and it is my primary passion.
